smime-mta - a S/MIME wrapper for the local MTA

DESCRIPTION
-----------

smime-mta is a wrapper for the local MTA, typically ssmtp or sendmail, that
ensures that all messages are encrypted using S/MIME.  The program will first
look for certificates in the local cache.  Any missing certificates are
retrieved from a remote LDAP server.

INSTALLATION
------------

perl Build.PL
./Build
./Build install

UNINSTALL
---------

./Build uninstall

USAGE
-----

Typicall installations will create a symlink the local MTA to smime-mta.

Example:
    mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail.real
    ln -s /usr/local/sbin/smime-mta /usr/sbin/sendmail

If you're using ssmtp then sendmail is already a symlink to ssmtp and just
needs to be pointed at smime-mta.

Once the MTA symlink is in place, configure the 'mta' option in smime-mta.conf
to the full path to the real MTA (e.g. ssmpt or sendmail).
